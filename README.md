# **Nuclear Discussions on Twitter: A Social Network Analysis** 🌍🔬

## 🔍 **Project Overview**
This project explores the discourse on **nuclear topics** (energy, war, safety, etc.) across six languages on Twitter. By analyzing a month-long dataset of tweets, we studied **retweet networks**, **user mentions**, **word frequency**, **sentiment analysis**, and **topic modeling** to understand how people engage with this critical global issue.

## 🛠 **Technologies & Tools Used**
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R  
- **IDE/Platforms**: PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio  
- **Data Storage**: JSON, CSV  
- **Libraries**:
  - Python: `networkx`, `matplotlib`, `wordcloud`, `nltk`, `pandas`
  - R: `syuzhet`, `stm`

## 📌 **Key Analyses**
1. **Retweet Network Analysis**  
   - Studied the structure and connectivity of retweet networks for six languages.
   - Identified key influencers and the most retweeted content.

2. **User Mentions and Top Hashtags**  
   - Analyzed which users/pages were most mentioned in tweets.
   - Extracted and ranked the top hashtags for each language.

3. **Word Frequency**  
   - Identified the most frequent terms in tweets, filtering out common stopwords to focus on nuclear-related topics.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Extracted emotional content from tweets (e.g., fear, trust, anger) to understand public sentiment toward nuclear issues.

5. **Topic Modeling**  
   - Applied Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to identify key topics discussed in the dataset.

## 🌟 **Key Findings**
- **Retweet Networks**: High percentage of original tweets vs. retweets suggests broader, less centralized discussions. Key influencers often included political figures.
- **Sentiments**: Fear was the dominant emotion, followed by trust, reflecting the duality of nuclear energy as both a threat and a solution.
- **Topics**: The primary topics included war, energy production, safety concerns, and political implications.

## 🚀 **Challenges & Biases**
- Language recognition errors due to short tweet text.  
- Dataset limitations, including the exclusion of certain keywords and languages.  
- STM's computational constraints and sensitivity to the number of topics.  

## 🎯 **Future Directions**
- Incorporating advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models for better topic extraction and sentiment classification.  
- Expanding the dataset to include real-time Twitter data for dynamic analysis.  
- Exploring **visualization techniques** for interactive exploration of network graphs.
